- Generate nice url button to display on all pages with matching urls.
- Setting to rewrite urls in DOM
- Settings page
    - Add/edit urls
    - Remove urls
    - Enable/disable urls
    - Enable/disable whole plugin
- Export url config
- Import url config
- Insert defaults on plugin install
- Logging
- Behat?


NOTES:
- As we are doing shortnames of things with [a-z0-9] when we convert links to short links, need to strip out other chars.
- Requires config change at top of file (because some plugins do require some do require_once and if it does require() then it fucks up):
    global $CFG;
    if (!isset($CFG)) {
        $CFG = new stdClass();
    }
- Mod records need higher ordernum than course, as they both start with course, so they need to be run first. Same goes for any which have the same start.

----------------
Record:

^course\/(\d+)\-(.*?)\/(.*+)
/course/${3}.php?id=${1}	[
 {
 "id": 3,
 "type": "plain"
 },
 {
 "id": 1,
 "type": "plain"
 }
 ]
